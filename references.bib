  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI){\textemdash}defined as a system's ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation{\textemdash}is a topic in nearly every boardroom and at many dinner tables. Yet, despite this prominence, AI is still a surprisingly fuzzy concept and a lot of questions surrounding it are still open. In this article, we analyze how AI is different from related concepts, such as the Internet of Things and big data, and suggest that AI is not one monolithic term but instead needs to be seen in a more nuanced way. This can either be achieved by looking at AI through the lens of evolutionary stages (artificial narrow intelligence, artificial general intelligence, and artificial super intelligence) or by focusing on different types of AI systems (analytical AI, human-inspired AI, and humanized AI). Based on this classification, we show the potential and risk of AI using a series of case studies regarding universities, corporations, and governments. Finally, we present a framework that helps organizations think about the internal and external implications of AI, which we label the Three C Model of Confidence, Change, and Control.},

Report no. DES4702. Issued April 2017. Royal Society). A small fraction of these data is collected with the aim of validating specific hypotheses. These studies are led by the development of mechanistic models focused on the causality of input–output relationships. However, the vast majority is aimed at supporting statistical or correlation studies that bypass the need for causality and focus exclusively on prediction. Along these lines, there has been a vast increase in the use of machine learning models, in particular in the biomedical and clinical sciences, to try and keep pace with the rate of data generation. Recent successes now beg the question of whether mechanistic models are still relevant in this area. Said otherwise, why should we try to understand the mechanisms of disease progression when we can use machine learning tools to directly predict disease outcome?},

  abstract = {Estimation of influenza-like illness (ILI) using search trends activity was intended to supplement traditional surveillance systems, and was a motivation behind the development of Google Flu Trends (GFT). However, several studies have previously reported large errors in GFT estimates of ILI in the US. Following recent release of time-stamped surveillance data, which better reflects real-time operational scenarios, we reanalyzed GFT errors. Using three data sources\textemdash GFT: an archive of weekly ILI estimates from Google Flu Trends; ILIf: fully-observed ILI rates from ILINet; and, ILIp: ILI rates available in real-time based on partial reporting\textemdash five influenza seasons were analyzed and mean square errors (MSE) of GFT and ILIp as estimates of ILIf were computed. To correct GFT errors, a random forest regression model was built with ILI and GFT rates from the previous three weeks as predictors. An overall reduction in error of 44\% was observed and the errors of the corrected GFT are lower than those of ILIp. An 80\% reduction in error during 2012/13, when GFT had large errors, shows that extreme failures of GFT could have been avoided. Using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, one- to four-week ahead forecasts were generated with two separate data streams: ILIp alone, and with both ILIp and corrected GFT. At all forecast targets and seasons, and for all but two regions, inclusion of GFT lowered MSE. Results from two alternative error measures, mean absolute error and mean absolute proportional error, were largely consistent with results from MSE. Taken together these findings provide an error profile of GFT in the US, establish strong evidence for the adoption of search trends based 'nowcasts' in influenza forecast systems, and encourage reevaluation of the utility of this data source in diverse domains.},

  abstract = {Anticipating intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy is critical in supporting decision makers to impose (or relax) measures that mitigate COVID-19 transmission. Mechanistic approaches such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models have traditionally been used to achieve this objective. However, formulating such models is challenged by the necessity to formulate equations for plausible causal mechanisms between the intensity of COVID-19 transmission and external epidemic drivers such as temperature, and the stringency of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Here, we combined a neural network model (NN) with a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model (SEIR) in a hybrid model and attempted to increase the prediction accuracy of existing models used to forecast ICU occupancy. Between 1st of October, 2020 - 1st of July, 2021, the hybrid model improved performances of the SEIR model at different geographical levels. At a national level, the hybrid model improved, prediction accuracy (i.e., mean absolute error) by 74\%. At the cantonal and hospital levels, the reduction on the forecast's mean absolute error were 46\% and 50\%, respectively. Our findings illustrate those predictions from hybrid model can be used to anticipate occupancy in ICU, and support the decision-making for lifesaving actions such as the transfer of patients and dispatching of medical personnel and ventilators.},

Core to the interpretation of complex and heterogeneous biological phenotypes are computational approaches in the fields of statistics and machine learning. In parallel, constraint-based metabolic modeling has established itself as the main tool to investigate large-scale relationships between genotype, phenotype, and environment. The development and application of these methodological frameworks have occurred independently for the most part, whereas the potential of their integration for biological, biomedical, and biotechnological research is less known. Here, we describe how machine learning and constraint-based modeling can be combined, reviewing recent works at the intersection of both domains and discussing the mathematical and practical aspects involved. We overlap systematic classifications from both frameworks, making them accessible to nonexperts. Finally, we delineate potential future scenarios, propose new joint theoretical frameworks, and suggest concrete points of investigation for this joint subfield. A multiview approach merging experimental and knowledge-driven omic data through machine learning methods can incorporate key mechanistic information in an otherwise biologically-agnostic learning process.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               A key problem in bioinformatics is that of predicting gene expression levels. There are two broad approaches: use of mechanistic models that aim to directly simulate the underlying biology, and use of machine learning (ML) to empirically predict expression levels from descriptors of the experiments. There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches: mechanistic models more directly reflect the underlying biological causation, but do not directly utilize the available empirical data; while ML methods do not fully utilize existing biological knowledge.                                         Results               Here, we investigate overcoming these disadvantages by integrating mechanistic cell signalling models with ML. Our approach to integration is to augment ML with similarity features (attributes) computed from cell signalling models. Seven sets of different similarity feature were generated using graph theory. Each set of features was in turn used to learn multi-target regression models. All the features have significantly improved accuracy over the baseline model - without the similarity features. Finally, the seven multi-target regression models were stacked together to form an overall prediction model that was significantly better than the baseline on 95\% of genes on an independent test set. The similarity features enable this stacking model to provide interpretable knowledge about cancer, e.g. the role of ERBB3 in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line.                                         Conclusion               Integrating mechanistic models as graphs helps to both improve the predictive results of machine learning models, and to provide biological knowledge about genes that can help in building state-of-the-art mechanistic models.},

Traditionally, ILI surveillance data are updated weekly and provided at a spatially coarse resolution. Producing timely and reliable high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts for ILI is crucial for local preparedness and optimal interventions. We present Theory-guided Deep Learning-based Epidemic Forecasting with Synthetic Information (TDEFSI),1 an epidemic forecasting framework that integrates the strengths of deep neural networks and high-resolution simulations of epidemic processes over networks. TDEFSI yields accurate high-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts using low-resolution time-series data. During the training phase, TDEFSI uses high-resolution simulations of epidemics that explicitly model spatial and social heterogeneity inherent in urban regions as one component of training data. We train a two-branch recurrent neural network model to take both within-season and between-season low-resolution observations as features and output high-resolution detailed forecasts. The resulting forecasts are not just driven by observed data but also capture the intricate social, demographic, and geographic attributes of specific urban regions and mathematical theories of disease propagation over networks. We focus on forecasting the incidence of ILI and evaluate TDEFSI's performance using synthetic and real-world testing datasets at the state and county levels in the USA. The results show that, at the state level, our method achieves comparable/better performance than several state-of-the-art methods. At the county level, TDEFSI outperforms the other methods. The proposed method can be applied to other infectious diseases as well.},

Models based on machine learning have emerged as a promising alternative to address these problems, but these models currently lack the precision to give crucial information on the magnitude of barrier heights, influence of solvents and catalysts and extent of regio- and chemoselectivity. Here, we construct hybrid models which combine the traditional transition state modelling and machine learning to accurately predict reaction barriers. We train a Gaussian Process Regression model to reproduce high-quality experimental kinetic data for the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction and use it to predict barriers with a mean absolute error of 0.77 kcal mol               −1               for an external test set. The model was further validated on regio- and chemoselectivity prediction on patent reaction data and achieved a competitive top-1 accuracy of 86\%, despite not being trained explicitly for this task. Importantly, the model gives error bars for its predictions that can be used for risk assessment by the end user. Hybrid models emerge as the preferred alternative for accurate reaction prediction in the very common low-data situation where only 100–150 rate constants are available for a reaction class. With recent advances in deep learning for quickly predicting barriers and transition state geometries from density functional theory, we envision that hybrid models will soon become a standard alternative to complement current machine learning approaches based on ground-state physical organic descriptors or structural information such as molecular graphs or fingerprints.},

  abstract = {Physics-based models are often used to study engineering and environmental systems. The ability to model these systems is the key to achieving our future environmental sustainability and improving the quality of human life. This article focuses on simulating lake water temperature, which is critical for understanding the impact of changing climate on aquatic ecosystems and assisting in aquatic resource management decisions.               General Lake Model (GLM)               is a state-of-the-art physics-based model used for addressing such problems. However, like other physics-based models used for studying scientific and engineering systems, it has several well-known limitations due to simplified representations of the physical processes being modeled or challenges in selecting appropriate parameters. While state-of-the-art machine learning models can sometimes outperform physics-based models given ample amount of training data, they can produce results that are physically inconsistent. This article proposes a               physics-guided recurrent neural network model (PGRNN)               that combines RNNs and physics-based models to leverage their complementary strengths and improves the modeling of physical processes. Specifically, we show that a PGRNN can improve prediction accuracy over that of physics-based models (by over 20\% even with very little training data), while generating outputs consistent with physical laws. An important aspect of our PGRNN approach lies in its ability to incorporate the knowledge encoded in physics-based models. This allows training the PGRNN model using very few true observed data while also ensuring high prediction accuracy. Although we present and evaluate this methodology in the context of modeling the dynamics of temperature in lakes, it is applicable more widely to a range of scientific and engineering disciplines where physics-based (also known as mechanistic) models are used.},

  abstract = {Despite its great success, machine learning can have its limits when dealing with insufficient training data. A potential solution is the additional integration of prior knowledge into the training process which leads to the notion of informed machine learning. In this paper, we present a structured overview of various approaches in this field. We provide a definition and propose a concept for informed machine learning which illustrates its building blocks and distinguishes it from conventional machine learning. We introduce a taxonomy that serves as a classification framework for informed machine learning approaches. It considers the source of knowledge, its representation, and its integration into the machine learning pipeline. Based on this taxonomy, we survey related research and describe how different knowledge representations such as algebraic equations, logic rules, or simulation results can be used in learning systems. This evaluation of numerous papers on the basis of our taxonomy uncovers key methods in the field of informed machine learning.},
